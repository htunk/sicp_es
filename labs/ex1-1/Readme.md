## Exercise 1-1

What is the result printed by the interpreter in response to each expression?, Assume that the sequence is to be evaluated in the order in which it is presented.
```scheme
10
(+ 5 3 4 )
(- 9 1)
(/ 6 2)
(+ (* 2 4)(- 4 6))
(define a 3)
(define b (+ a 1))
(+ a b (* a b)
(= a b)

```scheme
1 ]=> 10
(+ 5 3 4 )
(- 9 1)
(/ 6 2)
(+ (* 2 4)(- 4 6))
(define a 3)
(define b (+ a 1))
(+ a b (* a b)
(= a b)
